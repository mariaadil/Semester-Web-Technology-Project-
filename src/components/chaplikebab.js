              <p id='brhist_p'>
              Mughal culinary influences in the region popularised a number of kebab dishes, resulting in local recipes such as the Chapli Kebab. The name chapli is said to be derived from the Pashto word chaprikh/chapdikh/chapleet, meaning "flat" â€“ alluding to the kebab's light, round and flattened texture. Chapli kebab is a minced meat patty widely popular in Pakistan. Mixed with a blend of spices, ground beef is flattened into patties and shallow-fried until the exterior is charred and flavorful. Serve in a bun with pickled red onions or with a side of pita bread.
