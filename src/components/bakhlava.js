              <p id='brhist_p'>
              Baklava has a rich and layered history, much like its own intricate layers of phyllo dough and nuts! Its origins trace back to the imperial kitchens of the ancient Middle East. While there isn't a definitive pinpoint on its exact birthplace, it's widely believed that baklava has roots in the Assyrian civilization around the 8th century B.C.

Over time, the recipe evolved as different cultures and empires adopted and adapted it to their tastes. The Assyrians, Greeks, Romans, and eventually the Ottomans all had their versions of this delightful dessert.
